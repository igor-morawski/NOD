### Dataset Introduction
We present a high-quality large-scale dataset of outdoor images targeting low-light object detection. The dataset contains more than 7K images and 46K annotated objects (with bounding boxes) that belong to classes: _person_, _bicycle_, and _car_. The photos were taken on the streets at evening hours, and thus all images present low-light conditions to a varying degree of severity. We used two DSLR cameras to capture the scenes: Sony RX100 VII and Nikon D750, and throughout the paper, we refer to the sets collected by these cameras as Sony and Nikon (data)set. We show the statistics of our dataset in the table below.

| Dataset | Camera | #classes | #annotated images | #instances | #unannotated images |
|--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |
| Sony | Sony RX100 VII | 3 | 3.2k | 18.7k | 0.9k |
| Nikon | Nikon D750 | 3 | 4.0k | 28.0k | 0 |
| NOD (in total) | Sony+Nikon | 3 | 7.2k | 46.7k | 0.9k |
