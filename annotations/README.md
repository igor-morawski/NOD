# Introduction
This is annotation for the NOD dataset from our paper _NOD: Taking a Closer Look at Detection under Extreme Low-Light Conditions with Night Object Detection Dataset_, BMVC 2021
COCO-style annotation. We provide:
* COCO-style annotation for the whole dataset and for each camera subset separately,
* manual extreme/non-extreme instance annotation for the Sony test subset.

## Subsets

| Dataset | Camera | #classes | #annotated images | #instances | #unannotated images |
|--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |
| Sony | Sony RX100 VII | 3 | 3.2k | 18.7k | 0.9k |
| Nikon | Nikon D750 | 3 | 4.0k | 28.0k | 0 |
| NOD (in total) | Sony+Nikon | 3 | 7.2k | 46.7k | 0.9k |

## Development and test split

| Dataset | Train | Validation | Test | Comment | 
|--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |
| Sony | 80% | 10% | 10% | random split | 
| Nikon | 80% | 10% | 10% | random split |
| NOD (in total) | 80% | 10% | 10% | (Sony and Nikon combined) |


## Extreme/Non-Extreme Low-Light Label
Instance-level extreme/non-extreme low-light annotation is available for Sony test set in ```NOD_Sony_RX100m7_test_extreme_nonextreme.json```. 
This is still compatible with API from ```pycocotools```: for each bounding box you can access the flag by indexing your ann by ```isextreme``` key.

```
>>> from pycocotools.coco import COCO

>>> coco = COCO("NOD_Sony_RX100m7_test_extreme_nonextreme.json")

>>> # Load anns with ids 0, 5
>>> bbox0, bbox5 = coco.loadAnns([0, 5])

>>> bbox0["isextreme"]
False
>>> bbox5["isextreme"]
True
```

## Notes
* ```area``` is calculated as ```h*w``` of a bbox, 
* image and anno. ```id```s are created by enumeration (from 0 to #img) for each JSON file separately! _I.e._, image and anno. 
```id```s don't correspond to each other between annotation files. _E.g._, image with an ```"id":250``` in ```NOD_Sony_RX100m7_test.json``` is NOT the same as the image with the same ```"id":250``` in ```NOD_Sony_Nikon_test.json```, 
* ```NOD_Sony_Nikon_{split}.json``` = ```NOD_Sony_RX100m7_{split}.json``` âˆª ```NOD_Nikon750_{split}.json```.
